### Homework 2 ###
##################

## Step 1: Get the data ##

# This will be a first foray into scraping for many of you.
# You will quickly get addicted.

# We need the rvest package to harvest data.
library(ROI)
library(ROI.plugin.glpk)
library(ompr)
library(ompr.roi)
library(rvest)

# First, we read the entire page in
cyclists <- read_html("https://www.procyclingstats.com/rankings/me/individual") %>% 
  # Then, we extract all of the tables on the page
  html_table() %>% 
  # And then we pull out the first table
  `[[`(1)

# This will leave you with a data frame containing 100 cyclists.

## Step 2: Create a dummy column for Team Jumbo-Visma ##

# I'd like to create a binary indicator column (i.e., dummy column)

# I want to give a 1 to everyone on that team and a 0 to those not on that team.

# The ifelse function is handy for testing a condition and providing values
# for the true condition, the first value, and the false condition. 

cyclists$jumbo_dummy <- ifelse(test = cyclists$Team == "Jumbo-Visma", 
                              yes = 1, 
                              no = 0)

# Check to make sure it worked. If you sum all of your 1's:
 
sum(cyclists$jumbo_dummy)

# It should be the same value here:

summary(as.factor(cyclists$Team))

## Step 3: Create a dummy for Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl Team

# I'll do the same thing, but with Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl Team.

cyclists$quick_dummy <- ifelse(cyclists$Team == "Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl Team", 1, 0)

# Quick Dummy just so happened to be my nickname in track.

# Now that you have your data prepped and ready, 
# You need to save your data and then load
# it into a qmd file.

save(cyclists, file = "cyclist_data.RData")

# Just as a reminder, this is how you load RData:

load("cyclist_data.RData")

# You don't assign it, because the object(s) you are loading is/are already names

## Step 4: Build the team ##
 
# I want you to build a team of 10 distinct riders.
# You want your team to have as high of a point average as possible.
# Naturally, there are a few rules to handle:
# 1. You can only have one rider from Jumbo-Visma (all my friends hate them)
# 2. You have to have at least two riders from Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl Team

# Who is on your team?

points <- as.matrix(cyclists["Points"])

jumble <- as.matrix(cyclists["jumbo_dummy"])

alpha <- as.matrix(cyclists["quick_dummy"])

obj_val <- t(points)

con_margins <- c(10, 1, 2)

con_dirs <- c("==","==",">=")

A_mat <- cbind(rep(1, length(100)), jumble, alpha)

AA_mat <- t(A_mat)

total_constraints <- L_constraint(L = AA_mat, 
                                  dir = con_dirs, 
                                  rhs = con_margins)

model_create <- OP(objective = obj_val, constraints = total_constraints, 
                   types = rep('B', length(obj_val)), maximum = TRUE)

model_solved <- ROI_solve(model_create)

model_solved$solution

##ANS:
##Pogačar Tadej, Evenepoel Remco, van Aert Wout, Vlasov Aleksandr, Pedersen Mads
##Bilbao Pello, Kristoff Alexander, Valverde Alejandro, Philipsen Jasper, Jakobsen 
##Fabio are on the team
